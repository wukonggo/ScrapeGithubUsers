# Opensource Heroes Scraper

This Python script is designed to scrape the names of all users from the website https://opensource-heroes.com/developers, with support for pagination.

## Setup

We use Conda to manage the Python environment. If you haven't set up your environment yet, follow these steps:

1. Install Anaconda or Miniconda (if not already installed).

2. Create and activate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n learn python=3.9 -y
   conda activate learn
   ```

If you've already created the environment, simply activate it using:  
```bash
conda env list
```

Then install the required packages with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
